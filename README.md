This project was originally meant as a way to translate Bad Apple into ASCII and then made to become a template for any kind of animation to ascii.

you will need to save every frame of your animation inside a folder following a naming scheme that increases by +1 every frame.

If you want to put the code to test right away, you can find all of Bad Apple's frames in:
> https://github.com/Felixoofed/badapple-frames/tree/main

Just remember to rename your ImagePath variable to whatever your folder is
